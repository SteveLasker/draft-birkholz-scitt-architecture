--- abstract

A transparent and authentic ledger service in support of a supply chain's integrity, transparency, and trust requires all peers that contribute to the ledgers operations to be trustworthy and authentic. In this document, the supply chain context is illustrated using problem statements, requirements are derived from use case definitions, and architectural constituents are specified and illustrated in usage scenarios. The resulting architecture is intended to enable multi-layer interoperability to produce and leverage believable trust assertions while maintaining a minimal adoption threshold.
